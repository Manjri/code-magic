/*
Remove Specified Characters
Write an efficient function in C that deletes characters from a string. Use the prototype
string removeChars( string str, string remove );
where any character existing in remove must be deleted from str. For example,
given a str of “Battle of the Vowels: Hawaii vs. Grozny” and a remove of “aeiou”,
the function should transform str to “Bttl f th Vwls: Hw vs. Grzny”. Justify any
design decisions you make and discuss the efficiency of your solution.
